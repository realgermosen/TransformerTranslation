# Language translation using transformer

Date updated: 9/19/2022 1:33 PM (UTC-05:00) Eastern Time (US & Canada)

Description:
This is a Neural machine translation with a Transformer and Keras. This document demonstrates how to create and train a sequence-to-sequence Transformer model to translate Portuguese and Spanish into English. Most of the components are built with high-level Keras and low-level TensorFlow APIs. The Transformer was originally proposed in "Attention is all you need" by Vaswani et al. (2017).

This code will be used as a base to build more powerful neural networks models upon it where other languages are also integrated in the training set. Then, speech recognition technology will be implemented as a first attempt to create a voice to voice translation from one language to another.
